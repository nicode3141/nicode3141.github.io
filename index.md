# What's [FLL](https://www.first-lego-league.org/de/allgemeines/was-ist-fll.html)  
FIRST® LEGO® League is a support programme that introduces children and young people to science and technology in a sporting atmosphere. This is intended to make it easier for them to access scientific subjects and to awaken their motivation to learn an engineering or IT profession at an early age. 

The aim is

to inspire children and young people for science and technology
Development of team spirit among the participating groups
to encourage children and young people to tackle complex tasks with creative solutions
The research and robot competition combines the fun of technology and science with the exciting atmosphere of a sporting event. In a team, the children and young people work on a common topic like real engineers. They plan, program and test a fully automatic robot to master tricky missions. They have the opportunity to gain valuable practical experience in working with complex technologies and improve their problem-solving skills - and all this with a lot of fun and imagination!
